                <p>When you first start working in the real world, especially at an investment bank, it can be very intimidating. You feel like everyone else is so much smarter than you. You never seem to finish anything. Here are some fundamental pointers for making it through the initial few months:
                    <ol>
                       <li>
                        Excel should be mastered as soon as you can because first-year analysts who excelled at it stood out and were frequently requested to join transaction teams. Over time, you will get much, much better at Excel, but if you are proficient right away, you are a highly sought-after resource.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        Google is your friend. Don't ask your superiors any silly questions that Google can readily resolve. I can assure you that if you inquire about Excel, fundamental accounting and finance, etc., your coworkers will become irritated with you. Having said that, don't be hesitant to ask if you have any questions about a crucial aspect of any analysis you are performing so that you don't make a mistake. The secret is to learn as much as you can on your own. The best ability you can acquire in finance is the capacity for autonomous work.
                       </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>You should be able to do all tasks assigned to you during your second year as an analyst without much assistance from others. You'll increase your productivity significantly and be able to manage a considerably heavier workload. Three years of working as an investment banking analysis taught me a lot about how to differentiate yourself from your competitors and become a top-bucket analyst.
